  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a late night snack hack that I use to elevate my ramen at night so its not just a salty snack but a very
    weak attempt at cooking a hearty meal full of love <3
  </p>
  <p>Prepare your instant noodles as usual by boiling water with the spice packet, but only use half of the water suggested in the instructions. Then, the magic happensâ€”stir in half a can of cream of mushroom soup until the mixture is perfectly smooth without any lumps.

    Finally, add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. The noodles might take slightly longer than usual to cook. By simmering the ramen directly in the soup mixture, the ramen will soak up all the creaminess and flavor and turn the broth into a silky, spicy sauce that coats every noodle.
